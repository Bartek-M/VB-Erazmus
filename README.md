# VB - Erasmus
This are projects made during my Erasmus scholarship. All of them are made using **Visual Basic**. I learned basics of this language and GUI applications, while having fun creating new things.

> If you find any **bugs**, feel free to create a new **issue** on this repository.

## Projects
- Connect 4
- Euro Millions
- Maze
- Pong
- TicTacToe
- Web Browser

## Setup
I suggest using **Visual Studio** and opening them as projects, then starting from there. 

After pressing **Open a project or solution**, find `.vbproj` file and open it.
